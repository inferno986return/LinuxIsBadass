	A Very Boring Introduction<h1>
	<p><br/>
<br/>


	<p>	Over the years I've
	written a boatload of articles about Linux.  Not a big boat, mind
	you.  Possibly only a medium sized boat, but a boat nonetheless, and
	it was somewhat loaded.  Most of those articles being firmly in the
	“safe for work” camp.  Reviews, editorials, breaking news –
	fine, upstanding journalist-y stuff.</p>
	<p>	But, on occasion, I
	just don't feel like being upstanding.</p>
	<p>	That is where this
	book comes in.  This book is foul-mouthed and ridiculous.  This is
	my outlet for being profane and stupid – with a few intelligent
	thoughts (purely accidental, I swear) hidden underneath the F-bombs
	and neck-beard jokes.</p>
	<p>	This book is like
	that little valve on a hot water heater that releases steam,
	whenever the pressure gets too great, so that the damned thing
	doesn't turn into a missile.  Except, instead of steam, it's boner
	jokes.  Ergo, this book is the only thing that kept me from turning
	into a boner joke missile.  Which is now a real thing.  Because I
	just wrote those words together.</p>
	<p>	After I pulled
	together a few pieces, I realized it worked as a book.  Maybe not a
	classy book.  Nor a long book.  But a book.  Definitely, technically
	a book.  But there was something missing... something that I didn't
	realize right away.</p>
	<p>	What this book
	needed... was a choose your own adventure story.</p>
	<p>	Why not, right?  I'd
	already written a chapter called “It just works?  Fuck that!” so
	why limit myself?  I loved choose your own adventure books as a kid
	and figured an adventure focused on Linux would fit right in with
	the rest of this absurd collection of words.</p>
	<p>	So I wrote that and
	slapped it right on the end.  Because that's just the kind of book
	this is.</p>
	<p>	[Pro Tip: In various
	parts, throughout the book, you will find some some portions in
	square brackets.  Just like this paragraph.  Those are little asides
	I added in after I finished the book, and went back over it and had
	thoughts that I wanted to add to whatever it is I had written.  You
	can safely skip over the bracketed portions and still get the gist
	of things.  Usually.]</p>
	<h1 class="heading">
	A Badass Introduction.<h1>



	<p>What
	you are about to read is one seriously fucking important book.
	Every single, g-d damn word.</p>



	<p>Because
	Linux is badass.  Seriously badass.  We're talking Sylvester Stalone
	and Chuck Norris had their genes combined to create a clone baby.
	And that baby kicked a football to the moon.  And then the moon
	fucking exploded.  And fucking candy flew out.  Good candy too, not
	like fucking red vines or some shit like that.</p>



	<p>[“not
	like fucking red vines or some shit like that”.  Hemingway, eat
	your heart out.]</p>



	<p>This
	is a book about that.  About Linux.  And Linux achieving such
	stellar levels of badassery.</p>



	<p>Don't
	know what Linux is?  Fuck you.  This book isn't for you.  Stop
	reading right now and go buy a book about the history of tampons;
	you can't handle this book.  How the shit did you even manage to
	find this book?</p>



	<p>[Yay!
	 Alienating my potential customer base!  I'm going to make
	millions!]</p>



	<p>Know
	what Linux is but don't think it's baddass?  Read this book.  Read
	the shit out of this book.  When you're done you'll know why you
	were being such a complete dumb-ass.</p>



	<p>[Huh.
	 So, in my head, apparently “badass” is just one, plain old
	normal word and “dumb-ass” is hyphenated.  I almost deleted
	these last few lines during editing for fear that they would offend
	folks.  But I decided to keep them.  Because that's more badass.]</p>



	<h1 class="heading">
	Badass by comparison.<h1>



	<p>In
	order to declare something to be officially fucking badass, we must
	first create a baseline from which we can measure.  So let's take a
	look at all the other piece of shit operating systems out there to
	see if any of them are badass or not.</p>



	<p>Let's
	start with an exercise. Stand up, wherever you are, and say the
	following:</p>



	<p>
	“OH SNAP!  Did you see that copy of Windows that he's running on
	that PC over there?  That's just like the one my Aunt Tabitha uses!
	Badass!  I am blown away by how homogeneously hardcore that is!”</p>



	<p>Now
	take note of the fact that you feel like a retard just for saying
	that.  In fact, this is the first time, in human history, that those
	words have been put together in that order.  And it caused three of
	my fingers to spontaneously erupt into flames while I typed them
	out.</p>



	<p>[They
	didn't, actually.  I'm just pulling your leg there.  My fingers are
	fine.]</p>



	<p>“But,
	what about a Mac?  Those are pretty cool!” I hear some of you
	saying.</p>



	<p>No.
	 No they are not.  And you are a bad person for having said so.
	Here.  Let me help you out with a flowchart.</p>



	<p>…</p>



	<p>Ah,
	fuck it.  I'm too lazy to make a flowchart.  Just imagine one where
	there's a fuck-ton of arrows leading from “You Think Using a Mac
	is Cool” to “You Are a Bad Person”.</p>



	<p>But
	why?  Why are those other systems such steaming piles of donkey crap
	when compared with the badass – and minty fresh – awesomeness of
	Linux?  Excellent question!</p>



	<p>One
	might think that Linux is great simply by its very nature of not
	being Windows or MacOS.  But that thought would be wrong.  Let me
	paint a kick-ass picture for you.</p>



	<p>During
	a major league baseball game, you come up to bat.</p>



	<p>I
	know.  Sports metaphor.  Stick with me here.</p>



	<p>You
	step up to the plate, grip your bat, do that thing all baseball
	players do where they kick the dirt a little bit, and gaze out at
	the opposing team's pitcher.  Right about then you notice that he
	doesn't seem to be getting ready to throw the ball at you at all.
	In fact he looks like he's taking a wicked shit in his pants.  Then
	he sits down, right there on the pitcher's mound, and eats a ham
	sandwich.</p>



	<p>[Seriously.
	 What the fuck is the deal with that thing where they kick the dirt
	as they step up to the home plate?  Was the dirt not level enough?
	Was there something sparkly down there and they just needed to check
	it out real quick?  Makes no damned sense.]</p>



	<p>Looking
	around you notice all the other players on the field are also
	sitting down, pants full of their own doody, eating ham sandwiches.</p>



	<p>This
	does not mean that you are the best fucking baseball player to ever
	play the game.  All it means is that you didn't shit yourself and
	eat a ham sandwich.  At least, not right at that moment.</p>



	<p>[Though,
	now that I think about it, that is a good first step!]</p>



	<p>It
	means is that you have a chance.  The other players' incontinence
	(and non-Kosher diets) have given you an opportunity – a shot at
	being badass.  What you do with that shot is up to you.</p>



	<p>Now...
	I'm not saying that Windows and MacOS have full britches (in the
	not-awesome way).  But they are about as far from badass as you can
	get.  And that not only gave Linux the opportunity to badass it up,
	but the motivation as well.</p>



	<p>“Motivation?
	 How does having Windows and MacOS metaphorically crap themselves
	give motivation to... anyone?”</p>



	<p>Nature
	abhors a vacuum.</p>



	<p>“Whut?”</p>



	<p>If
	a field has no plants, some will soon grow.  If you have a tribe of
	warriors, one man must rise up to lead them.  If no badass Operating
	System exists, one must be made.</p>



	<p>And
	that, my dear friends, is why Linux is badass.  Because it must be.</p>



	<h1 class="heading">
	“It just works”?  Fuck that!<h1>
	<p><br/>
<br/>


	<p>	Let me tell you a
	little story.</p>
	<p>	Once upon a time,
	there was a perfectly average little boy.  Let's call him Stanley.</p>
	<p>	From the time
	Stanley was born, until his 18th birthday, he never had to work a
	single day.  No after school jobs, no mowing lawns for neighbors.
	What about chores around the house?  Surely he must have helped
	clean his room at least!  Nope.  Never did that either.  In fact,
	Stanley had never even washed a spoon.  His spoons were
	automatically cleaned.  By spoon cleaning fairies or some shit like
	that.</p>
	<p>	Whenever young
	Stanley was on the verge of getting hungry, food would magically
	appear before him.  And, not just any ordinary food... awesome food.
	 The exact food that he had been craving, without him even knowing
	that he was craving it.</p>
	<p>	Stanley had never
	experienced the concept of “inconvenience”.  The cable guy
	always showed up on time -- without making him wait around all day.
	Never did Stanley have to wait on hold on the phone.  Never
	accidentally stepped in a puddle, causing his shoe to fill with
	nasty, street water.</p>
	<p>	Stanley was the most
	boring little fucker on the planet.</p>
	<p>	Was it his fault
	that he never had any of those life experiences that give the rest
	of us our character?  No.  No it wasn’t.  It was probably the
	fault of some asshole sorcerer who cast a spell on him... or
	something.  But, you know what?  It doesn’t matter.  He’s still
	a boring little fucker that none of us want to hang out with.
	(Unless our spoons are dirty and we feel lazy.)</p>
	<p>	Let’s look at the
	flip side of that example.  Let’s look at Edward, the guy that
	lives right next door to boring-as-fuck Stanley.</p>
	<p>	On Edward's first
	day of kindergarten, he accidentally walked down to the mud factory
	(which, in case you were wondering, is a factory... that makes mud)
	and applied for, and got, a job.  That's right, young Edward, quite
	unintentionally, was now a full time mud-maker.  7 am to 5pm every
	day.</p>
	<p>	And when Edward got
	home, he had to clean his room.  Because his baby sister had been in
	there.  Again.  The effect was not unlike a crazed, little tornado.</p>
	<p>	Oh, and food!  Poor,
	poor Edward.  When he wanted a burger, he got a pizza.  When he
	wanted a pizza, he got a burger.  When he was interested in neither
	a pizza nor a burger... he got both (with one inside the other).</p>
	<p>	Edward is, unlike
	Stanley, not at all boring.  In fact, Edward is a generally awesome
	dude that is fun to hang out with.  He knows what it's like to work
	hard, which means he is also quite familiar with playing hard as
	well.  And the stories!  Edward's stories, though predominantly
	about working in a mud factory, are the hit of every party.</p>
	<p>	There is a simple
	lesson we can learn from this:</p>
	<p>	Mac users are boring
	as fuck and shouldn't be invited to parties.  Ever.</p>
	<p>	[Man.  I just know
	some Mac fanboy is going to throw this back at me as proof that I
	think Macintoshes are great somehow.]</p>
	<p>	</p>
	<h1 class="heading">
	If everyone on earth drives a 1993 Toyota Corolla...<br/>
nobody has
	a badass car.<h1>
	<p><br/>
<br/>


	<p>	My first car was a
	1989 Buick LeSabre.  All white on the outside and all red on the
	inside.  It was a boat of a car.  Huge.  Difficult to park.  And it
	sucked down gas like an [offensive, racist metaphor to use for
	someone who drinks something really fast].</p>
	<p>	But I loved it.  The
	ride was smooth and the red-leather bench seats made this the
	ultimate car to take to a drive-in movie.  Driving it made me feel
	like a pimp.  Which was a pretty amazing accomplishment for this
	pasty, skinny little nerd.  And, even more importantly, I could
	afford it on my meager earnings as a
	dish-washer-turned-printer-repair-man.</p>
	<p>	The car was unique
	(or about as unique as most mass produced cars get).  It had style.
	It had personality.</p>
	<p>	... It got totaled
	by a truck delivering cheese only a few short years after I drove it
	off the lot.</p>
	<p>	[Seriously.  A
	cheese truck plowed into that poor Buick.  Stupid cheese truck.]</p>
	<p>	One of my
	co-workers, at the time, had a 1993 Toyota Corolla.  In blue.  A
	perfectly fine car.  Drove well and got reasonably good mileage –
	certainly it guzzled the gas at a far more reasonable pace than my
	big old Pimp-mobile.</p>
	<p>	There was just one,
	glaring, problem with that '93 Corolla: It seemed like every single
	other person in the greater Seattle metropolitan area had one too.
	Also in blue.</p>
	<p>	At first, he thought
	that was awesome.  Driving around town he would smile and waive if
	he pulled up next to another person in this particular car owner
	club.  Lots and lots of waving.  And smiling.</p>
	<p>	As the months
	dragged on, the smile vanished, with the wave turning into more of a
	limp raising of the pointer finger – without actually removing the
	hand from the steering wheel – in order to let the other
	Corolla-ite know that he had, indeed, noticed that they were driving
	the same damned car.</p>
	<p>	Eventually even that
	little finger-raising thing went away too.  Replaced, instead, by
	him adamantly refusing to make eye-contact with anyone driving that
	accursed car.  I call this “Adam's Grumpy Corolla Period”.</p>
	<p>	Oh, yeah, the guy's
	name was Adam.  I forgot to mention that.  Well.  Truth be told his
	name is pretty irrelevant.  We could change it to “Steve” and
	the story would be the same.  You know what?  Forget that I even
	told you his name.  It'll be more mysterious and exciting that way.</p>
	<p>	The “Grumpy
	Period”, for this UNNAMED DUDE OF MYSTERY, continued for quite a
	long time.  Maybe a year or so.  Not joking.  This man really
	started to hate his efficient little blue car.  Not through any
	fault of the cars, mind you – the car was just doing its job.  And
	it did it well enough.  Got him from point A to point B.  Never
	broke down.  It wasn't the roomiest or most comfortable car around,
	but it certainly did what it was designed to do.</p>
	<p>	He resented it.
	Even started kicking the tires.</p>
	<p>	And not in that “I'm
	going to tap the tires with my feet in order to see if they're of
	good quality” way.  More in the “Take that you piece of shit
	car” way.  It was hard to watch this Man-Car relationship, that
	started out with so much love and hope... devolve into something
	so... sucky.</p>
	<p>	[Seriously.  What's
	the deal with “kicking the tires”?  Why do people do that?  Are
	there really cars out there that falls apart when a person kicks a
	tire lightly?  Does the wheel just pop off?]</p>
	<p>	But, eventually, all
	his negative car-feelings lost steam.  His spirit was broken by the
	blue, metal (and plastic) beast.</p>
	<p>	About this point he
	began to reconnect with the rest of the Corolla-driving world.  Not
	in an angry way, nor in a happy way.  What was once a smile and
	waive had become... a shrug.  Here, let me walk you through a
	typical experience:</p>
	<p>	Adam... I mean SOME
	GUY... pulls up to a stop light in his little blue car.  Right next
	to his car is another one, just like his – only in a slightly
	different shade of blue – driven by another man who also looks
	like he's had his will broken.</p>
	<p>	The two men make eye
	contact.</p>
	<p>	One man shrugs and
	cocks his head, ever so slightly, to the side.  As if to indicate
	“Yeah.  I know.  Piece of shit car, right?”.</p>
	<p>	The other man does
	that thing that's half-way between a smile and a frown and slowly,
	and slightly, nods his head.  Closing his eyes for just an instant,
	as if weeping, quietly, deep down.  They understand each others
	pain.</p>
	<p>	At that moment any
	car could pull up beside them... and that third car would instantly
	be awesome.  Just by it's very nature of being different.  A beat up
	pick-up truck with a duct taped muffler and mudflaps with busty
	ladies on it.  One of those tiny little two-seaters that look like
	plastic escape pods.  Or my big, old boat of an '89 Buick.  All
	would be made instantly more awesome by simply not being the same as
	every other damned car.</p>
	<p>	Now, I'm not big on
	the whole “using cars as a metaphor for computers” thing.  Been
	overdone.  And, really, it doesn't even apply most of the time.
	Computers and cars are, as you may have noticed, not the same thing.
	 But, in this particular case, I'm going to force this analogy to
	work.  (And, yes, I know that a &quot;metaphor&quot; is not the same
	thing as an &quot;analogy&quot;... but I'm going to force that to be
	the case as well.  Through sheer will power.)</p>
	<p>	Let's do an
	experiment.  Go around and look at the faces of people using PC's
	running Windows.  Doesn't matter what they're doing.  Note the look
	of distant sadness in their eyes.</p>
	<p>	Then sit down next
	to them with your laptop, running Linux.  You could be using any
	flavor of Linux.  Any Desktop Environment -- KDE, GNOME, Unity... it
	truly doesn't matter.  Don't say a word.  Don't make a point of
	showing them what your computer screen looks like or what you are
	running... just make sure they can see it out of the corner of their
	eye.</p>
	<p>	[Yes.  There are
	multiple people... but they only have one eye, between them, of
	which they can see out of the corner of.]</p>
	<p>	Give it a few
	minutes.  Wait until they've definitely noticed that you're not
	running Windows.</p>
	<p>	What you do from
	there is entirely up to you.  Just note two things:</p>
	<ol>
		<li/>
<p>You have just
		made another human being, who had already had his will broken by a
		boring Operating System, even more sad.</p>
		<li/>
<p>You are
		awesome.</p>
	</ol>

	Say GNU/Linux One More Time.  I dare ya.<h1>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="border: none; padding: 0cm">
	<br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		I get in a fair bit of trouble for not saying
	“Gee-En-You-Forward-Slash-Linux”.  As most of you probably know,
	that is what Richard Stallman, and a bunch of other guys, like to
	call any Linux distro.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		The reason they like to call it “GNU/Linux” instead of just
	plain old “Linux” is that many of the GNU projects (such as the
	GCC compiler) are pretty critical to building and using a system
	sitting on top of the Linux kernel.  That logic makes total sense.
	So I get where they're coming from.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		Unfortunately I simply cannot call it “GNU/Linux”.  You know
	why?  Because it is a stupid, fucking name.  It just is.  It sounds
	dumb.  It looks dumb.  And it makes me feel like a dumb-ass whenever
	I say it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		Shit.  We could call the entire system “puppy fart infection”
	for all I care.  I would still use it and love it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		In fact, I think it's damned weird that anyone would care about
	what people call Linux.  As long as we all use the same words (or
	close) so that we know what we're all talking about, that's good
	enough for me.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		No.  I'm wrong on that.  It's not weird that someone would care.
	Because, obviously, I care.  Otherwise I wouldn't be writing this
	little ditty right now.  What's weird is that someone would make a
	big stink about it.  Such as Richard Stallman refusing to speak at
	events that use the word “Linux” without also putting a “GNU/”
	in front of it.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		[Wait.  Shit.  I say it's weird that someone would make a stink
	about it... when I am making a stink about it.  Fuck.  I'm loosing
	this argument with myself.]</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		I mean, if you're going to make a stink about a name that refers to
	a big group of software, built by a large number of people, at least
	make the name a good one.  RoboSharkLazer or something.  That way
	it's more fun for me.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		That's really a key point, I suppose.  I'd really appreciate if
	everyone chose project names that I found amusing.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		Another thing that irks me: being adamant about calling it
	“GNU/Linux” is making a point that multiple projects and people
	contributed significantly to whatever Linux distro you are running.
	Now, I'm all for people and projects getting proper credit.  But if
	we're going to feel compelled to name our Operating System by
	creating a large list of included project names (with lots of
	forward slashes) things would get fucking ridiculous in a heartbeat.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		GNU/Linux/Qt/GTK/ncurses/wget/Firefox/GNOME/KDE/GEdit... on and on
	it goes.  Until someone punches me in the nose.  To cut all of those
	projects out of that name would be extremely disrespectful to them.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		And, really, even then that doesn't feel properly indicative of the
	actually system being used.  Why is “GNU” listed first?
	Wouldn't it make more sense to list the project names in order of
	closeness to the hardware?  The GNU tools really sit on top of the
	Linux kernel (in a way).  So “Linux/GNU” would make far more
	sense.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="border: none; padding: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		All of which tells me that the whole “GNU/” thing is pure
	vanity.  Which... I am totally, completely okay with.  I love
	vanity.  I am one vain mother-fucker.  [This is true.]  But I also
	like it when people, in the act of being vain, simply own up to it.
	Owning up to vanity is badass.</p>

	Badass Leadership.<br/>

beat
	up your marketing dude.”)<h1>

<br/>


	<p>	Steve Balmer, the
	current CEO of Microsoft, has a reputation of being... a bit
	intense.  He has a tendency to get up in front of the Microsoft
	faithful and, while taking on the role of the cheerleader, work
	himself into a minor frenzy.  &quot;Developers, Developers,
	Developers, Developers&quot; goes the chant.</p>
	<p>	His enthusiasm for
	what he does, and what people within his company do, is tangible.
	And, let's be honest, that can be rather charming.  In a sweaty,
	frightening way.</p>
	<p>	[Overly long side
	note: Back during the release of Windows 2000, I worked at
	Microsoft.  Specifically I worked on a team building Windows Media
	Player for Mac OS and Solaris – which was a totally real thing.
	Despite me having no real involvement in the Windows 2000 launch
	itself, I got to go to the launch party.  Which had laser tag.
	Which was pretty fucking sweet.  Wait.  Why did I bring this up?
	Oh, right.  Balmer.  So Balmer was there to speak to the crew.  I
	ended up standing in the front row, with my plate of party food,
	when he took the stage.  Many things were said to get the troops
	excited.  But then something... intense happened.  He jumped into
	talking about Linux.  Specifically how much he hates it.  “I.
	HATE.  LINUX.”  He really got into it.  When all was said and done
	there was a significant number of spittle drops on my glasses and I
	scooted out of there in a hurry.  I don't say this to suggest that
	Balmer spit on me (though, technically, he did)... but to show just
	how damned passionate and animated the man is.]</p>
	<p>	Balmer has style
	(or, at least, a style).  Balmer has personality.  He may not be
	your cup of tea, but you can't deny those two facts.  Just the same,
	at the end of the day, Balmer is a salesman.  He's in marketing.
	Which severely limits his awesome potential.</p>
	<p>	Let's look at the
	flip-side of that coin: Richard Stallman.</p>
	<p>	Stallman, the
	founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project, is...
	Oh, jeeze.  How do I say this... He is a strange little dude with a
	big beard.</p>
	<p>Stallman
	makes over-the-top statements about an almost mind-boggling number
	of topics.  Wondering what he thinks about human beings having sex
	with dolphins?  Well, my friend, that is damned convenient.  Because
	he's talked about it and you can find his ideas on Man-Dolphin love
	(which you can never, ever get out of your head again) right on the
	Internet.</p>



	<p>Want
	to watch a video of him picking shit off his feet, and eat it (and
	go back for seconds), while he addresses an entire room full of
	Linux users?  Bam.  On the Internet.  (Again... no chance you can
	forget that.  Some things simply cannot be unseen.)</p>



	<p>Now
	I'm not saying this to demonstrate anything bad about Stallman.
	Quite the contrary.  These examples (which are 2 of roughly 5
	million bat-shit-crazy things that the man has said or done over the
	years) simply prove two simple points.</p>



	<ol>
		<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		Richard Stallman doesn't give a flying fuck what you think of him.
		He's going to do shit his way.</p>
		<li/>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">
		Richard Stallman &quot;thinks outside the box&quot;.</p>
	</ol>



	<p>When
	I say &quot;thinks outside the box&quot;, I don't mean it in that
	uber-annoying corporate way – like when you're manager, at your
	performance review, instructs you to spend more time &quot;thinking
	outside the box&quot; and you just kinda want to punch him in the
	eye-ball.</p>



	<p>No.
	 I'm talking about REALLY thinking outside the box.  Here.  Let me
	illustrate with an example.</p>



	<p>Normal
	&quot;Thinking Outside The Box&quot; : You need to ship a box of
	CD's to Florida by tomorrow morning -- but it's too late to use
	conventional shipping services.  So you buy a plane ticket and fly
	over to Florida that night to get the CD's there on time.</p>



	<p>REALLY
	&quot;Thinking Outside The Box&quot; : Same problem.  More awesome
	solution.  Create a black hole that eats the entire land-mass
	between you and Florida -- thus making Florida suddenly within
	walking distance, even from Australia (which is 18 million miles
	away from anything).  Sure, millions of people were killed in the
	process.  But at least you didn't need to fly on the red-eye.</p>



	<p>That
	right there is the big difference between your average, every day
	technology company leaders and the kind of leaders we have in the
	Open Source and Linux world.  Where most projects are led by
	reasonable people with, potentially, a few quirks -- we, in the
	Linux world, get crazy mother-fuckers who will eat those reasonable
	peoples' brains, absorb their power, then attack Los Angeles with an
	army of radioactive rodents.</p>



	<p>And
	Stallman is but one example.  The Linux world is lousy with folks
	with similar inclinations and endless power.</p>



	<p>Also
	neck beards.  A lot of our guys have neck beards.</p>

	<p>	What follows is an

	<p>	I should also note

	what that right path is.  In fact, if you follow the right path the

	<p>	OPERATING SYSTEM NOT

	<p>	That's all.  Just a
	black screen and those words, in pale white, on your gorgeous new
	32&quot; LCD screen.  At least you know your newly built computer is
	working.  The RAM check passed and, apparently, you managed to shove
	the CPU into the right spot.  That wasn't a foregone conclusion, so
	you're pretty psyched about that little victory.</p>
	<p>	You fold your arms
	across your chest and lean back, confidently, in your chair –
	smiling and slowly nod your head.  You probably look badass right
	now.  Like a young Charlton Heston after showing those damned dirty
	apes a what-for.</p>
	<p>	The smile vanishes
	as the meaning of those bold, all-caps words slowly dawns on you:
	You had forgotten to get an Operating System to put on your new,
	glorious tower of a computer.  Luckily, there's only a few real

	<p>	1) Choose Windows -

	<p class="western" align="right" style="font-weight: normal; page-break-before: always">
	Part 2</p>
	<p>	As luck would have
	it, you happen to have a few DOS floppies laying in a box right by
	your desk.</p>
	<p>	Why these floppies
	are in the box, and why the box is, itself, right next to your desk,
	would make for an interesting story.  One involving old boxes filled
	with old computer crap.  Pretty riveting stuff.</p>
	<p>	Also lucky: the fact
	that you had the foresight to install a floppy drive in your brand
	new PC.  Sure, floppies are outdated.  But what if you &quot;needed
	do get some important files off a floppy sometime&quot; you thought
	to yourself.  The guy down at your local Nerd Stuff, who helped you
	ring up the parts, made fun of you.  Something about him never
	having seen one in person before.  Who's laughing now, kid?</p>
	<p>	You slide the floppy
	into the disk drive and reboot.</p>
	<p>	A:\&gt; SETUP.EXE</p>
	<p>	The letters are on
	the screen before you even knew what was happening.  It's almost
	like... your fingers remember.  They knew what you needed to type.
	&quot;It's good to be home&quot;, you think to yourself -- confident
	in your decision to just use DOS.</p>
	<p>	&quot;What do I need
	a newer Operating System for anyway?  DOS has everything I'd ever
	need, right?&quot; you say, rather loudly, to the empty room that
	was busy not giving a shit.</p>
	<p>	The Setup program
	finishes up, you reboot and your computer comes to rest at a C:\&gt;...
	when it dawns on you.  You don't actually have any DOS software to
	run.  Also you have no idea how to get online with DOS.  The last
	time you did that was with an old 28.8 modem -- and you don't have
	one of those.</p>

	<p>	Oh-ho!  What's this?
	 Out of the corner of your eye you spy a Commander Keen install
	floppy in the box.  Looks like this is your lucky day!  You slip the
	floppy in the disk drive, run the installer, and spend the rest of
	the afternoon enjoying the best that early 1990's gaming could
	offer.</p>

	 Decision made.</p>
	<p>	Only one problem.
	You don't actually have any way to install Linux.  And, with no

	<p>	You head to the

	<p>	Just then a college

	 Nay.  College WOMAN.  You begin to, mindlessly, move towards what,
	you are pretty sure, is the most amazing lady you've ever seen.  She
	would love to go to Comic Con with you, all you need to do is ask.
	Of this you are sure.</p>
	<p>	The man who gave you

	<p>	You have no idea

	and Ted “Theodore” Logan, so you go with it.</p>
	<p>	1) Celebrate with
	some froyo - turn to part 14</p>
	<p>	2) Head home and
	install Linux - turn to part 15</p>
	<p>	3) Throw the DVD in
	his face and install Windows - turn to part 4</p>

	Part 7</p>
	<p>	You get home, let

	<p>	Luckily, you're

	<p>	Still no dice.  And
	that little troubleshooting wizard is really starting to piss you
	off.</p>
	<p>	After much
	investigating (and swearing) you realize that Windows does not have
	the driver for your Ethernet card.  So you'll need to go online to
	download it.  Unfortunately you can't get online.  Because you don't
	already have the driver that lets you get online.  Which sort of
	makes you want to punch a hobo.</p>

	<p>	I'm not going to

	Part 10</p>
	<p>	Feeling defeated --
	and all alone in this cruel, cruel world -- you head back to the
	local Nerd Stuff to buy a new network card.  This may seem like a
	drastic move to some, but you are a man with needs.  Specifically,
	you need Internet access so that you can download and install
	updates to your new PC all night long.</p>
	<p>	&quot;Welcome to
	Nerd Stuff!  Anything I can help you find?&quot; says the
	blue-shirted, happy man.</p>
	<p>	&quot;I need a NIC.&quot;</p>
	<p>	&quot;I'm sorry,
	what's that?&quot;</p>
	<p>	You smile.  But deep
	inside you want this man to die.  &quot;Ethernet card.  I need an
	Ethernet card.&quot;</p>
	<p>	&quot;Oh, no
	problem!  Though you probably mean you want a wireless router&quot;</p>
	<p>	You cut him off.
	&quot;No.  Ethernet card.&quot;</p>
	<p>	&quot;Totally
	understand.  Let me show you what we've got.  Ah!  Here's a great
	802.11&quot;</p>
	<p>	Again.  Cut him off.
	 Because he's an idiot.  &quot;No.  Ethernet card.&quot;</p>
	<p>	&quot;Hmm.  I see.
	Hold one while I get someone from the computer department.&quot;</p>
	<p>	As the man heads off
	to find help, you finally allow yourself to breath and begin hunting
	for your new network card.  Unfortunately there seems to be only one
	option.  And it is the exact same card you already have.  You are,
	needless to say, both bummed and frustrated.</p>
	<p>	Just then,
	inspiration strikes!  You look around – like a super sneaky spy
	dude – to make sure nobody is looking.  Then, acting as casually
	as possible, you pop open the box of the NIC.  Which is harder to
	open than you'd think, what with all that tape on the end.  The box
	now looks like it was chewed on by a Tauntaun.</p>
	<p>	What's more... no CD
	inside.  No driver.  You just molested that poor box for nothing.</p>
	<p>	You casually place
	it back on the rack, angled so that the &quot;chewed on&quot; side
	is less visible, and try to decide what to do next.</p>

	<p>	And... it's...
	wait... something's not quite right...</p>
	<p>	About 20 reboots
	later you come to a pretty major decision: This isn't working.
	Apparently MacOS doesn't like something about your PC.  Huh.  You'd
	love to do some quick research to figure out what the problem is...

	<p>	You stroll into the

	cut off before you can finish.</p>

	<p>	“Well.  No.  I

	<p>	“You'll need an

	<p>	You have no idea how

	things you have ever heard.  After, what seems like, several minutes
	of a stupidity-induced coma, you finally manage to reply.
	“Soooo...”</p>
	<p>	The man points to a
	big screen behind the “Genius Bar” – which, and this seems
	worth noting, looks just like a normal counter.  “Is your name on
	that screen?”</p>
	<p>	It isn't.  But, you
	have an idea.</p>
	<p>	“Hey, look over
	there!”</p>
	<p>	You hustle over to
	one of the “Geniuses” and the “Bar” and quickly explain your

	<p>	“You can't install
	Mac OS on a PC!  Bwahahahaha!  Hey everyone!  This guy is trying to

	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	After

<br/>


	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	As time
	marches steadily onward, two things become face-punching-ly clear: I
	suck (rather spectacularly) at eating spaghetti without making a
	major damned mess… and Linux increases its level of Badassery at
	an exponential rate.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	It is
	with this crucial truth in mind -- the Linux thing, not the
	spaghetti thing… I don’t even know why I brought that up -- that
	I decided “Linux is Badass” deserved to be updated for 2014.  If
	Linux is going to be so much more mind-exploding-ly amazing in 2014
	than in 2013, so too must this book step up its game.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	In the
	pages that follow you will gain a glimpse into my soul.  That spark,
	deep down, that makes me who I am.  That differentiates me from
	people who have normal jobs.  My essence.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	That’s
	right.  Poetry.  About Linux.  Often using the word “fuck”.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	“How
	does a bunch of dirty poetry explain how Linux is Badass?  This book
	is shitty and Bryan Lunduke is an asshole.”</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	An
	excellent question, random prick I just made up!  I’ll tell you!</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	If you
	can read a poem -- on any topic -- and, at the end, sit back and
	think to yourself, “that was pretty badass”... then that proves
	the topic of the poem itself to be of an extraordinary level of
	badassness.  Case in point, that man from nantucket.  (You know, the
	“There once was a man from Nantucket” guy.)  That dude?  Badass.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	I also
	have a firm belief that most amazing things in this world can be
	ruthlessly ridiculed and, if they truly are as stellar as we think
	they are, they emerge looking even more badicall than before.  Also,
	as that guy I made up a few paragraphs pointed out, I’m an
	asshole.  So many of these poems are making fun of Linux.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal">	Because
	Linux is awesome.  And it can take it.</p>

	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">Gather
	’round, my friends and hear a most nerdy tale.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">A tale
	about Linux (and a very small whale).</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">Our
	story begins back in nineteen ninety three.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">With
	some dude named Ian, who had a girlfriend, you see.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">Her
	name was Debra, if I’m remembering right.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">So he
	put their names together, and made some Linux one night.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">And so
	Debian was born from two names together.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">(We’re
	just lucky it wasn’t “Brangelina” or “Bennifer”.)</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">Fast
	forward, ye all, to two thousand and four.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">When
	some astronaut dude wanted to make something more.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">“This
	Debian’s cool,” he said.  “I like it a lot!”</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">“But
	if it were orange and brown?  Hot damn, that’d be hot!”</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">So he
	took his space money and started a team.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">And
	created a warthog, the best we’d yet seen!</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">Oh,
	everyone loved it!  Oh, everyone cheered!</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">Except
	those wearing red hats, or with a neck beard.</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">The
	spaceman got excited, “I know just what to do!”</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">“We’ll
	build it for TVs and probably phones too!”</p>
	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal"><br/>
<br/>


	<p class="western" align="center" style="font-weight: normal">“There’s
	no way we can lose!  No way we can fail!”</p>
