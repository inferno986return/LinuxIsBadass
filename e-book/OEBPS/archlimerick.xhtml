	<h1 class="heading">“Arch gets a limerick”</h1>

	<p class="quote center top">There once was a distro called Arch</p>
	<p class="quote center">With updates always on the march</p>
	<p class="quote center">I packman -Syu’d</p>
	<p class="quote center">And went out to get food</p>
	<p class="quote center">When I came back it was on a death march</p>

	<p class="noindent top">Ok. That was a pretty lazy rhyme. Rhyming “march” with “march”? Lame. Plus, it doesn't really
	represent Arch that well. Perhaps that final line should read:</p>
	<p>“When I came back my whole system was really fucked up and LibreOffice wouldn’t fucking launch.”</p>
