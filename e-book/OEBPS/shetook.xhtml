	<h1 class="heading">“She took my dog, my truck and my gratuitous desktop effects.”</h1>

	<p class="quote center top">Wobbly windows were so fucking tight.</p>
	<p class="quote center">I dream about them every damned night.</p>

	<p class="quote center top">My windows popped out and looked all 3D.</p>
	<p class="quote center">It felt, a bit, like being on LSD.</p>

	<p class="quote center top">And when I hit close, it all caught on fire.</p>
	<p class="quote center">It lifted my soul up higher and higher.</p>

	<p class="quote center top">Oh, Compiz! Oh, Beryl! Where have these things gone?</p>
	<p class="quote center">Without them in my life, it’s so hard to press on!</p>

	<p class="quote center top">Don't fuck with me, man. I ain't no noob.</p>
	<p class="quote center">Just bring me back my damned spinning cube.</p>
